# AI Account Automation

A Bash-based project for generating customized prompts to use with NotebookLM, tailored for different clients based on industry and company name.

## Overview

This project streamlines the creation of personalized AI prompts for multiple clients. It uses template files and a configuration system to automatically generate client-specific versions without manual editing.

## Prerequisites

- **Bash shell** (available on macOS, Linux, and Windows with WSL/Git Bash)
- Basic command-line familiarity
- notebooklm-py
	- pip install notebooklm-py
	- pip install "notebooklm-py[browser]"
	- playwright install chromium

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasoande/ai_automation
   cd ai_automation
   ```

2. Ensure the scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x wrapper.sh
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Configure clients** - Edit `vars.sh` to define your clients:
   ```bash
   CLIENTS=("Client1" "Client2" "Client3")
   ```

2. **Generate prompts** - Run the main script:
   ```bash
   bash wrapper.sh
   ```

3. **Find your outputs** - Customized prompts are saved in client-specific directories.

## Configuration

Client-specific variables are defined in `vars.sh`. This file contains:
- A list of client names
- Industry variables for each client
- Company name variables for each client

Edit `vars.sh` to add, remove, or modify client definitions as needed.

### Example vars.sh Structure

```bash
CLIENTS=("Hershey" "Merck" "Acme")

# Client: Hershey
Hershey_industry="Food & Beverage"
Hershey_name="Hershey Company"

# Client: Merck
Merck_industry="Pharmaceuticals"
Merck_name="Merck & Co."
```

## Usage

### Generating Prompts

Run the main script to generate customized prompts for all configured clients:

```bash
bash wrapper.sh
```

This will:
- Read client variables from `vars.sh`
- Process each `prompt*.txt` template file
- Replace placeholders (`$industry` and `$name`) with client-specific values
- Save customized prompts in client-specific directories (e.g., `Hershey/`, `Merck/`)

### Output

- **Location**: Customized prompt files are saved in subdirectories named after each client
- **Naming**: Each output file retains the original prompt template filename (e.g., `prompt1.txt`)
- **Example**: A template `prompt1.txt` becomes `Hershey/prompt1.txt`, `Merck/prompt1.txt`, etc.
